# Crop Survival Game

This repository contains a terminal-based game developed in C++ for my Object-Oriented Programming class. The game demonstrates the use of inheritance and polymorphism to simulate a farming scenario where the player must keep their crops alive for 10 days.

## Game Overview

In this game, you play as a farmer tasked with growing and maintaining crops. You can choose between different crops, such as wheat and corn, which are derived from a base Crop class using inheritance. Your goal is to keep your chosen crop alive for 10 days by managing its humidity and fertilizer levels and treating it for occasional fungus and bug infestations.

**Good luck, Farmer!**

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes inheritance and polymorphism to create a flexible and extendable crop management system.
- **Playable Crops**: Choose between different crops, each with its own set of attributes.
- **Game Mechanics**: Maintain your crops by keeping the humidity and fertilizer levels within certain thresholds, and respond to random events like fungus and bug infestations.

## Installation

To run the game, you'll need to have Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 installed with the "Desktop development with C++" workload.
